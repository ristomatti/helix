# Fork of Helix which adds support for Github-copilot

### To use:
### 1. Setup the copilot-lsp using my helper script:

1. Install [fish](https://fishshell.com/) (for my script), install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which runs the copilot-lsp)

2. Run `fish copilot.fish --create-lsp` 
<br>This will download the copilot-lsp and put its in `/usr/local/bin/` (if you havenâ€™t already)
3. Run `fish copilot.fish --auth` 
<br>This will create a github copilot-lsp access code in `~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json` (if one doesn't already exist)

### 2. Choose keybindings to map to these copilot-commands, for example:
```
[keys.insert]
"C-w" = "copilot_apply_completion" 
"C-e" = "copilot_show_completion"

[keys.normal]
"C-e" = "copilot_toggle_auto_render"

[editor]
copilot-auto-render = false # defaults to true if omitted
```

### 3. Run helix with copilot: `hx -a`

With helix started with this flag ommited (eg `hx`), the copilot-lsp is not started at all and no completions are requested.

With helix started with `hx -a`, copilot-completions are requested from the copilot-lsp when entering insert mode, and anytime that the document changes while in insert mode (typing a character, deleting a word etc).

With `copilot-auto-render = true`, completions are rendered immediately after they are received from the copilot-lsp.

With `copilot-auto-render = false`, a completion will only render if `copilot_show_completion` is pressed after the completion was first requested. This behaviour then resets after the next completion is requested.

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune's design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

It's a terminal-based editor first, but I'd like to explore a custom renderer
(similar to Emacs) in wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/<lang>/` for `indents.scm`.
